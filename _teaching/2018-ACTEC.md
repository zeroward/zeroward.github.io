Advanced Cyber Threat Emulation (ACTE) was a course created by myself to teach the members of the Air Force's Enterprise Computer Emergency and Response Team's (AFCERT) Threat Emulation Team the skills necessary to perform emulation-focused penetration tests of the United States Air Force's various enterprise networks. This course acted as a qualification course that allowed them to perform their mission.
