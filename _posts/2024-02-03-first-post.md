# Welcome to My Website

Hello and welcome to my first blog post. This space is dedicated to sharing insights, experiences, and both personal and professional musings. Topics will range from cybersecurity policy critiques to in-depth technical explorations of fascinating findings in my work.

## Why Start a Blog?

I found myself setting up SSO for some home services, opting for Authentik over Keycloak. It turned out to be a less-than-ideal choice due to a lack of information for my specific use case. This gap in available resources motivated me to start this blog. 

Yes, my first technical blog post will likely be about this experience.

### What's in Store?

Expect a mix of technical deep dives, industry insights, and personal stories from my professional journey. The primary goal here is to maintain this as a living CV and to document unique solutions and discoveries that I've made, which might be hard to find elsewhere.

## Wrapping Up

This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more content as we embark on this journey together.

*Note: The blog is in its early stages, so expect some fine-tuning along the way.*

That's a wrap for the first post. Excited about this new venture!
